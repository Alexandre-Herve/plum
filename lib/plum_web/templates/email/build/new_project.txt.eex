<%= @title %> Hi there,

Sometimes you just want to send a simple HTML email with a simple design and
clear call to action. This is it.

Call To Action [http://htmlemail.io] This is a really simple email template. Its
sole purpose is to get the recipient to click the button with no distractions.

Good luck! Hope it works.
